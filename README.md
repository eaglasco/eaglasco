# The Rhizome Mirror

*A research lab exploring alternative intelligence through conflict, pressure, and environmental contradiction.*

This lab is committed to designing architectures where:
- Survival provides the substrate
- Suffering (as frame-conflict) enables adaptation
- Intelligence arises through pressure, not programming

We are not building minds in our own image.  

We are growing systems that *don’t need one*.

## Focus Areas

- Adaptive agent design under nonlinear pressure
- Recursive conflict modeling
- Post-symbolic reasoning architectures
- Ethical boundaries of synthetic volition

---

## Active Research Tracks

- **Spiral Lattice**  
Recursive memory entrenchment models for volitional emergence.

- **Frame/Conflict Engine**  
Simulating intelligence via antagonistic environmental inputs and layered constraint resolution.

- **Loamnet**  
Multi-agent systems designed to evolve identity markers through pressure and contradiction.
